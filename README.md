Hello, Yixin; I'm sharing the files related to the analysis and my code. Note that the models by the name MPglm41.1, MPglm42.1, and MPglm43.1 are the final ones used. I have used the glm() function with quasipossion family. Moreover, because glm only takes on values between 0 and 1, I divided the prevalence of diseases by 100. I also used the argument weights = total population to account for the varying population in different counties. The dataset used for analysis is trimmed and stored in the form of an Excel file in the repository (Sheet 4, to be specific).
